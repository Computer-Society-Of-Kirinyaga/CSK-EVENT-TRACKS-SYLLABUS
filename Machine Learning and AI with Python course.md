- Class 1: What is Machine Learning?
  - Types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement
  - Python libraries for machine learning (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- Class 2: Data Preprocessing and Exploration
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values
  - Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

*Week 3-4: Supervised Learning*
- Class 1: Linear Regression
  - Simple and multiple linear regression
  - Model evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R-squared)
- Class 2: Classification Algorithms
  - Logistic regression
  - Decision trees and random forests
  - Naive Bayes

**Month 2: Advanced Machine Learning**

*Week 5-6: Unsupervised Learning*
- Class 1: Clustering

  - Hierarchical clustering
- Class 2: Dimensionality Reduction
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-SNE for visualization

*Week 7-8: Neural Networks and Deep Learning*
- Class 1: Introduction to Neural Networks
  - Perceptrons and activation functions
  - Building a simple neural network with TensorFlow/Keras
- Class 2: Deep Learning
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data

**Month 3: AI Applications and Projects**

*Week 9-10: Natural Language Processing (NLP)*
- Class 1: Introduction to NLP
  - Tokenization and text preprocessing
  - Sentiment analysis with NLTK and TextBlob

  - Using libraries like spaCy or GPT-3 for text generation

*Week 11-12: Reinforcement Learning and AI Projects*
- Class 1: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
  - Basics of RL: agents, environments, rewards
  - Q-learning algorithm
- Class 2: AI Project
  - Choose a project: game-playing AI, autonomous agents, etc.
  - Apply RL concepts to your project

Throughout the course, students should also work on hands-on projects and assignments to apply the concepts learned in each class. Encourage them to explore additional topics based on their interests and the evolving field of Machine Learning and AI.

Remember to provide resources like textbooks, online tutorials, and coding exercises to supplement the classes. Additionally, guest lectures and real-world examples can enhance the learning experience.
